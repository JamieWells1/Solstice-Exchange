# Solstice Exchange

> **_Matching Engine, Pricing Engine, and Algorithmic Trading Strategy Bundled Into One Shared Library: Solstice_**

Solstice is a modular C++23 library which provides high-performance electronic trading systems. It integrates core exchange infrastructure such as a limit order book, order matcher, pricing simulator, and algorithmic strategy executor, all under a unified parent namespace.

- `solstice::matching` â€” Order book, matcher, order processor.
- `solstice::pricing` â€” Market simulation and pricing feed (WIP).
- `solstice::strategy` â€” Automated strategy execution (WIP).

## Performance

### Latest (v0.2.0, Multi-threaded)

> ðŸš€ Peak Throughput: **523,560 orders/sec** @ v0.2.0 on M4 MacBook Pro (multi-threaded)

| Orders Executed | Execution Time (ms) | Throughput (orders/sec) |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 100,000          | 191                 | 523,560                  |

## Status & Roadmap

| Component  | Status      | Next Steps |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Matching   | Complete | Minor optimizations, extended test coverage |
| Pricing    | In Progress | - Futures pricing (cost of carry model)<br>- Options pricing (Black-Scholes, Greeks calculation) |
| Strategy   | Planned  | Algorithmic trading strategy implementation<br>Initial focus: delta-neutral / volatility arbitrage |

### Roadmap Overview
1. **Matching Engine** â€” Foundation complete, ongoing refinements
2. **Futures Pricing** â€” Simple cost of carry model, integration with order book
3. **Options Pricing** â€” Black-Scholes implementation with full Greeks
4. **Trading Strategy** â€” Automated strategy executor leveraging derivatives pricing
5. **Extended Derivatives** â€” Additional asset classes and pricing models
