# Solstice Exchange

> **_Matching Engine, Pricing Engine, and Algorithmic Trading Strategy Bundled Into One Shared Library: Solstice_**

Solstice is a modular C++23 library for building high-performance electronic trading systems. It integrates core exchange infrastructure â€” including a limit order book, execution matcher, pricing simulator, and algorithmic strategy executor, all under a unified parent namespace.

While only the matching engine is fully implemented at present, the architecture is designed for clear separation of responsibilities across:

- `solstice::matching` â€” Order book, matcher, order processor.
- `solstice::pricing` â€” Market simulation and pricing feed (WIP).
- `solstice::strategy` â€” Automated strategy execution (WIP).

## Performance

### Latest (v0.2.0, Multi-threaded)

> ðŸš€ Peak Throughput: **523,560 orders/sec** @ v0.2.0 on M4 MacBook Pro (multi-threaded)

| Orders Executed | Execution Time (ms) | Throughput (orders/sec) |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 100,000          | 191                 | 523,560                  |
